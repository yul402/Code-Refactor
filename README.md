## Description
The **Horiseon Website Homepage Code Refactor** project aims to enhance the existing codebase of the Horiseon website's homepage. The primary objective of this project is to improve the efficiency, comprehensibility, and accessibility of the current code while maintaining the visual styling and layout of the page.

The project scope entails meeting specific criteria to fulfill the outlined objectives. These criteria include:

1. Ensuring Semantic HTML Elements: The revised codebase will incorporate semantic HTML elements that enhance the structural integrity of the webpage. This facilitates a clear and meaningful representation of content, unaffected by presentational aspects.

2. Establishing Logical Structure: The HTML elements will be organized in a logical structure that remains independent of styling and positioning. This promotes better comprehensibility for developers and assistsive technologies alike.

3. Accessible Alt Attributes for Images: Image elements within the webpage will feature descriptive and accessible alt attributes. These attributes provide meaningful descriptions of images for users relying on assistive technologies.

4. Sequential Heading Attributes: The heading attributes will adhere to a sequential order, improving the logical flow of content and enhancing readability.

5. Concise and Descriptive Title Element: The title element of the webpage will be revised to provide a concise and descriptive summary of the page's content, aiding users in understanding its purpose and relevance.

This project represents a valuable opportunity to contribute to both inclusivity and the agency's online visibility, thereby fostering a positive impact on the business's reputation and outreach.
